Simple [Mumble](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/) client written in Python on top of [Twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/).

Can only interact with the chat system. It can read messages sent in chat and respond.

A sample plugin is given, but any number of plugins can be written. The API is very primitive and limited though.
